<!--I had to paragraph every verse to create it into a descension. :D-->
	<p>
	[Intro]
	</p>
	<p>
	Hey, now now
</p>
<p>
	Goodbye love
	</p>
	

	<p>
	[Verse 1]
	</p>
	<p>
	Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
	</p>
	<p>
	I leaned back on my radio
	</p>
	<p>
	Some cat was laying down some rock 'n' roll
	</p>
	<p>
	"Lotta soul," he said
	</p>
	<p>
	Then the loud sound did seem to fade
	</p>
	<p>
	Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
	</p>
	<p>
	That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
	</p>

	<!--My favorite part of the song :P-->
	<p>
	[Chorus]
	</p>
	<p>
	There's a starman waiting in the sky
	</p>
	<p>
	He'd like to come and meet us
	</p>
	<p>
	But he thinks he'd blow our minds
	</p>
	<p>
	There's a starman waiting in the sky
	</p>
	<p>
	He's told us not to blow it
	</p>
	<p>
	'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
	</p>
	<p>
	He told me
	</p>
	<p>
	"Let the children lose it
	</p>
	<p>
	Let the children use it
	</p>
	<p>
	Let all the children boogie"
	</p>


	<p>
	[Verse 2]
	</p>
	<p>
	I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
	</p>
	<p>
	Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
	</p>
	<p>
	Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two
	</p>
	<p>
	Look out your window, I can see his light
	</p>
	<p>
	If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
	</p>
	<p>
	Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright
	</p>
<!--This was a long process.-->
<!--To make it look less messy, I used <p> code to achieve the look I needed.-->
	<p>
	[Chorus]
	</p>
	<p>
	There's a starman waiting in the sky
	</p>
	<p>
	He'd like to come and meet us
	</p>
	<p>
	But he thinks he'd blow our minds
	</p>
	<p>

	"Let the children lose it

	<p>
	Let the children use it

	<p>
	Let all the children boogie"
